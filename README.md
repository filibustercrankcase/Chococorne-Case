# Chococorne-Case
This is just a simple case for the Chococorne PCB designed by DavidPhilipBarr based on Foostans Corne Keyboard design. The PCB can be mounted using low profile M2 standoffs, or in my case I'm currently using adhesive hook and loop dots, but 3M tape would work as well. The tented version is only the left half, so mirror it to print the right half.
